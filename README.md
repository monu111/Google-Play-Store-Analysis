GOOGLE PLAY STORE ANALYSIS


1.Introduction

Google Play Store:-

Google Play, formerly Android Market, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. 

Google Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google e-Bookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are Google Play Books, Google Play Games, and Google Play Music, which is in the process of being phased out in favour of YouTube Music and Google Podcasts, and formerly included Google Play Newsstand before it was phased out in November 2018, and Google Play Movies & TV before being renamed to Google TV in September 2020.

The Google Play Store is one biggest and most important parts of Android. It’s the central hub for all app and game content as well as off-shoots for ebooks, movies, TV shows, and music. 
The Google Play Store is a digital storefront for various types of media. People most commonly use the app to download various apps and games. However, the Play Store also sells ebooks, music, TV shows, and movies. Everything, aside from apps and games, has its own app so we can optionally browse those sections only.


While Google Play is strongly associated with Android, it is not a part of the stock Android experience. It’s actually an extra piece of software for Google’s specific Android experience. That’s why the Play Store isn’t available on Android forks like Amazon’s Fire OS. OEMs must adhere to a specific set of rules to get Google apps and the Play Store is part of that package. There are alternate app stores available for Android as well.
